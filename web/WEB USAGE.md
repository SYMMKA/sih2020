Here, you’ll find a step by step guide on how to use all the features available.You can come back to this section whenever required by clicking on [the help icon](wudimages/Aspose.Words.1866fca9-b1ea-47ab-b7d2-ed8dafc92ee1.001.png) on the top right of the screen.

Here are some quick steps you can take to make sure you successfully set up your library with AlphaByte to take maximum advantage of the platform. We've included support links for each step in case you need any further explanation of how something works.

2. Add books and assets using [mass import](#importbooks) via settings or [individually](#addnewmaterial) via the add page. As you add new assets to the library, a unique QR code is generated for each copy of the item. Print and apply these QR codes to the respective items. This will enable you to perform quick scan searches on the items in future.
3. Register issuers (students or teachers) with [mass import](#importuserdetails) or add new issuers [individually](#addnewuser).
4. Set up [virtual shelves](#virtualshelves) to reflect your physical shelf organization. Print and apply QR codes for each shelf to successfully keep track of all items on each shelf.
