# Getting Started : Web for Admin

Welcome to AlphaByte! This is where we help you get acquainted with all the features so that you can use them to manage your library with ease. Here, you’ll find a step by step guide on how to use all the features available.

Here are some quick steps you can take to make sure you successfully set up your library with AlphaByte to take maximum advantage of the platform. We've included support links for each step in case you need any further explanation of how something works.

1. [Set up an admin hierarchy](#adminfunctionclearance) and add each admin individually or [import admin details](#importadmindetails) quickly with a csv file.
2. Add books and assets using [mass import](#importbooks) via settings or [individually](#addnewmaterial) via the add page. As you add new assets to the library, a unique QR code is generated for each copy of the item. Print and apply these QR codes to the respective items. This will enable you to perform quick scan searches on the items in future.
3. Register issuers (students or teachers) with [mass import](#importuserdetails) or add new issuers [individually]().
4. Set up shelves
5.
