## Our Solution
AlphaÎ²yte is a web and app based, voice navigated library management system that offers voice enabled search of books from the internet and
automatic categorization of books or CDs or magazines new to the library, according to the [Dewey Decimal Classification System](https://www.oclc.org/en/dewey.html). 
- Google books API is used to extract information of books using REST APIs. 
- Information related to book can be searched from the internet and autofilled for faster data entry. 
- Voice based search is done by using [Web Speech API](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html). It enables developers to use scripting to generate text-to-speech output and to use speech
recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control.
