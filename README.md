## Problem Statement
**Library Software for Andaman College**

Computerization of Library Activities and Book Transactions.

Design a library management system for Andaman college that has voice-based search of books and automatic categorization of books in genres based on title. The system should search from the internet and get information about the book and put them into appropriate categories based on title, authors and information collected online.
