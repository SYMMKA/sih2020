# Contributing to AlphaByte

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/SYMMKA/sih2020/new/master/LICENSE.txt) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Following are some quick examples of good bug reports for your reference:

1. [An example from stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626)
2. [Another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. The above[ stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that anyone with a base R setup can run to reproduce the bug.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Our contributors love thorough bug reports. Really.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- [Comment ](https://qvault.io/clean-code/code-comments/)wherever necessary
